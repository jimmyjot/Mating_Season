# Mating_Season
Application of the game Mating Season, from an old Games Magazine article.

This repository holds my application of the Mating Season game. It has two-player and one-player versions. Initially, I'll create the one-player version. I will then try working on a two-player version, either hot seat or networked.

Rules for the one-player and two-player games:
